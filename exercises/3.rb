# EXERCISE
# Create a "shared" shopping list with a friend
# Create two data structures - one for your list of stuff, and one
# for your friend, e.g. you want milk, eggs, and bacon, and
# your friend wants beer, cookies, and apples.
# Programmatically combine the two arrays into a single list,
# sort the result (alphabetically), and write it to the screen.
# If the two lists contain the same item, only show it once!

# HINTS
# Learn to read the documentation!
# 

# puts "hello"

My_List = ["eggs", "scallions", "wine"]
Janus_List = ["eggs","hummus","hash browns"]
Our_list = My_List + Janus_List
puts Our_list.sort.uniq
